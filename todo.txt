Pass in tuning parameters
Expose performance statistics in to ros. CPU and call count of major functions.
- call counts and times for untwist, match, loop Closure
- memory and cpu externally?
- send as diagnostics
Use fewer tries for loop closure. Currently 300
- Quickly find nearby points. 
Speed up scan matching for large point count scans to run on Raspberry PI class computer
- Reduce point count
- Rough vs. fine matching
- Feature based estimate?
Scan untwisting should use odom as input_path.
Merge live mapping and process bag, if live, input will come from subscribed topic, asynchronous will come from function calls
Process bag should simply call service to process scan.
Track and cap memory usage
Remove deprecated pcl_conversionD::moveFromPCL
Make a map
Can closures be validated using map entropy?
    e.g. if you look a nearby scans, do they now align better or worse than before the closure?




Done
----
Scan untwisting should take into account whether any scans have been skipped.
process_bag Input and output files should be relative, not in "brian" folder
Re-add process_bag ROS outputs
Fix backward pose in process bag pose array - deferred, probably because lidar is turned 180 degrees on robot
G2O should be run from install location
Publish pose graph. Show odometry links and closure links with different colors.

Timings
-------
2/20/2023, process_bag for a3-lab-bar-kitchen-2020-07-14-21-38-09.out.bag on desktop
954 scans

timings:
    time untwisting: 0.0866838 count: 2859
    time moving: 24.0287 count: 3416575
    time diffing: 65.7843 count: 3416575
    time closing loops: 76.9543 count: 477
    time adding scans: 14.8727 count: 954
    g2o time: 1.19372 count: 59
    lidar_odom time: 0 count: 0
    total time matching: 90.0735 count: 3416575

observations: 
    moving, diffing called 1195 times for every untwist (gradient descent)
    odometry (adding scans) rate 64 scans per second
    loop closure rate about 6 scans per second, mostly just returning without adding closures
    g2o time about 20ms or 50 fps
