Expose performance statistics in to ros. CPU and call count of major functions.
- call counts and times for untwist, match, loop Closure
- memory and cpu externally?
- send as diagnostics
Speed up scan matching for large point count scans to run on Raspberry PI class computer
Scan untwisting should take into account whether any scans have been skipped.
Scan untwisting should use odom as input_path.
Merge live mapping and process bag, if live, input will come from subscribed topic, asynchronous will come from function calls
Process bag should simply call service to process scan.
Track and cap memory usage
Remove deprecated pcl_conversionD::moveFromPCL




Done
----
process_bag Input and output files should be relative, not in "brian" folder
Re-add process_bag ROS outputs
Fix backward pose in process bag pose array - deferred, probably because lidar is turned 180 degrees on robot
G2O should be run from install location
